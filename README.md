# Network Inference using information-theoretical approaches, statistical hypothesis tests, and the amplitude-phase modulated surrogate data method (PhD Thesis)

## Abstract

The last few decades have witnessed the emergence of network science, aimed at modelling natural phenomena across a diverse spectrum of disciplines, including biology, social sciences, and neuroscience, among others. One of the notable advancements in this field is the concept of mutual information rate (MIR), which quantifies the information flow per unit of time between different components (nodes) within a network. The \ac{MIR} framework holds the potential to reveal connectivity patterns in complex networks using time-series data. A critical challenge in utilising \gls{MIR} is the establishment of appropriate thresholds for successful network inference. We propose a new method to infer connectivity in networks using \ac{MIR}, statistical tests and amplitude-phase modulated surrogate data (APMSD).  The method uses \ac{MIR} and statistical hypothesis tests to infer network connectivity, introducing a new method to generate surrogate data, which removes the correlation of amplitude and synchronisation of the phases in the recorded signals, by randomising their instantaneous amplitudes and phases. The APMSD method compares \ac{MIR} of the pairs of signals from the network with the MIR values of the pairs of APMSD generated from the signals. We discuss the mathematical aspects of the \ac{APMSD} method and present numerical results for Gaussian-distributed correlated data, networks of coupled maps and continuous deterministic systems, stochastic Kuramoto system, and for dynamics on heterogeneous networks. The importance of our method stems from the analytic signal concept, introduced by Gabor in 1946 and Hilbert transform, as it provides us with the quantification of the contribution of amplitude (linear or nonlinear) correlation and phase synchronisation in the connectivity among nodes in a network. Our method shows great potential for recovering the network structure in coupled deterministic and stochastic systems and in heterogeneous networks with weighted connectivity.
